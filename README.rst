*Kroftig* ('git fork' backwards) is a web-based tool for auditing multiple related git
repositories. This repository holds the front end, which is written using React and Relay.
The back end is `here <https://github.com/smbolton/kroftig-backend>`_.

**Development of Kroftig is suspended**, for two reasons:

* The original project for which I planned to use Kroftig ceased to have value, and

* Graphene_, the Python GraphQL_ framework upon which the Kroftig backend is built, is not mature
  enough for anything but very straightforward use. When I return to this project, if
  Graphene hasn't matured, I will re-write the backend using Node.js and express-graphql_.

.. _Graphene: https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene
.. _GraphQL: http://graphql.org/
.. _express-graphql: https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql

At its present stage of development, Kroftig presents a React-based single-page
application in the browser, with which one may browse git repositories on the backend
server in much the same way as GitHub. As such, it may be an valuable base for custom
web-based git tools.

Installation
============

.. code:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/smbolton/kroftig-frontend.git

That last command will start the development server, and open a browser window which will load the
app from:
